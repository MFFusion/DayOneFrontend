## Understanding how applications connect to the server via HTTP and TCP

### Introduce the fundamentals of networking in Go

Applications communicate with each other over a network. A network is a group of computers connected to each other that can exchange data. The Internet is the largest network in the world, connecting billions of computers worldwide.
The application that initiates the communication is called the client, and the application that receives the communication is called the server. The client and server communicate using a protocol, which is a set of rules that governs how data is exchanged between applications. The client and server must agree on the protocol to use for communication.
That protocol is the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), 
which is the foundation of data communication on the Internet. 
HTTP is a request-response protocol, 
which means that the client sends a request to the server, and the server responds to the request. The client and server communicate over a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection, which is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable communication between the client and server.

This is a simplified overview of how applications communicate over a network. There are many other protocols and concepts involved in networking, but this is enough to get started with Go.

From the client's browser, this is what happens when we navigate to a website:
```
GET / HTTP/1.1 
Host: www.example.com
```
The client sends a GET request to the server. The GET request is a request for data from the server. The server responds with a response code, which indicates whether the request was successful or not. The response code is followed by the response body, which contains the requested data.

This is an example of a response from the server:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 13

Hello, World!
``` 
The response has three parts: the response code, the response headers, and the response body.
The response code is for indicating whether the request was successful or not. 

The response headers are for providing additional information about the response, such as the content type and length. 
Example of content types include text/html, which is used for HTML documents, and application/json, which is used for JSON data.
The response body contains the requested data, which is "Hello, World!" in this case.

HTTP is just that. HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is a protocol for transferring hypertext, which is text that contains links to other text. The World Wide Web is built on top of HTTP, which is why we often refer to the World Wide Web as the Web.

There are a few HTTP request methods, but the most common ones are GET and POST. The GET method is used to request data from the server, and the POST method is used to send data to the server. The GET method is used when we navigate to a website, and the POST method is used when we submit a form on a website.
Other HTTP request methods include 
1. PUT -> to update data on the server, 
2. DELETE -> to delete data on the server,
3. HEAD -> to get the headers of a response,
4. OPTIONS -> to get information about the server,
5. and TRACE -> to get information about the request.


Other than 200, there are many other response codes that indicate different things. 

For example, 404 means that the requested resource was not found, and 500 means that there was an internal server error. We will learn more about response codes later in this module.

Golang applications are often used as server applications, meaning that they receive requests from clients and respond to those requests. In this module, we will learn how to build a simple HTTP server in Go that can handle client requests.

### Creating a simple HTTP server in Go

```go
package main

func main(){
	// specify routes and handlers
	http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request){
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello World!")
    })
	
	// start the server
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}

```

The first part of the code specifies a handler, which is a function that handles requests to a specific route. The handler function takes two parameters: a ResponseWriter and a Request. The ResponseWriter is used to write the response to the client, and the Request contains information about the request, such as the request method and URL.

The second part of the code starts the server on port 8080. The ListenAndServe function takes two parameters: the port to listen on and the handler to use for incoming requests. In this case, we are using the default handler, which is the handler we defined above.

We can run the server by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
go run main.go
```
We have just created a simple HTTP server in Go! We can test it out by opening a browser and navigating to http://localhost:8080. We should see the message "Hello World!" displayed in the browser.

## 1.2 Understand the concept of writer and response for HTTP

### The Request-Response cycle in an HTTP server

The Request-Response cycle is the process of sending a request to a server and receiving a response from the server. The Request-Response cycle is used in many different applications, such as web browsers and mobile apps. In this module, we will learn how to build a simple HTTP server in Go that can handle client requests.

#### The anatomy of an HTTP request

An HTTP request consists of three parts: the request line, the request headers, and the request body. The request line contains the request method, the request URL, and the HTTP version. The request headers contain additional information about the request, such as the content type and length. The request body contains the data that is sent with the request, such as form data or JSON data.

#### The anatomy of an HTTP response

An HTTP response consists of three parts: the status line, the response headers, and the response body. The status line contains the response code, the response headers contain additional information about the response, and the response body contains the data that is sent with the response.


### The role of the `http.ResponseWriter` and `http.Request` in handling HTTP requests and responses

The Go standard library provides a package called net/http that makes it easy to build HTTP servers in Go. The package provides functions for creating HTTP servers, handling requests, and writing responses. In this module, we will learn how to use the net/http package to build a simple HTTP server in Go.

For every handler function, we need to specify two parameters: a ResponseWriter and a Request. The ResponseWriter is used to write the response to the client, and the Request contains information about the request, such as the request method and URL.

The ResponseWriter has a Write function that takes a byte slice as a parameter. The Write function writes the byte slice to the response body. The Request has a URL field that contains the URL of the request. We can use the URL field to determine which handler function to use for the request.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello World!")
    })

    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

If the user sends something in the body of the request, we can read it using the Request's Body field. The Body field is an io.ReadCloser, which is an interface that has a Read function that takes a byte slice as a parameter and returns the number of bytes read and an error. We can use the Read function to read the body of the request.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "io"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        body, err := io.ReadAll(r.Body)
        if err != nil {
            http.Error(w, "Error reading request body",
                http.StatusInternalServerError)
        }
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello %s!", body)
    })

    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

in this example, the fmt.Fprintf function writes the string "Hello" followed by the body of the request to the response body. The body of the request is a byte slice, so we need to convert it to a string before we can write it to the response body.
The first argument , *w* is a ResponseWriter, which is used to write the response to the client. The resulting string will be written to the response body.
